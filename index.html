    <section id="skills" class="skills-section">
      <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">About me</h2>
      <div class="text">
        I completed my schooling at Pioneer School in Partapur, located in the Banswara district, where I built a strong
        academic foundation and developed a disciplined and focused approach to learning. Over the years, I discovered
        my passion for technology and creativity through activities like gaming, coding, sports, and consistent
        studying. These interests have helped strengthen my logical thinking, teamwork, and problem-solving
        skills.<br><br>

        Driven by curiosity and a desire to build real-world solutions, I chose to pursue a B.Tech in Computer Science &
        Engineering. My long-term goal is to become a skilled software engineer who can contribute to innovative,
        high-impact projects that make everyday life easier and more efficient.
        <br><br>

        Outside academics, I constantly work on improving my communication, leadership, and time-management abilities. I
        also aspire to explore the world, gain new experiences, and learn from different cultures and environments. I
        believe that diverse exposure—not just technical knowledge—plays a major role in shaping a strong, adaptable
        professional.
        <br><br>
        I am eager to keep growing, learning, and pushing my boundaries while preparing myself for a successful career
        in technology.
